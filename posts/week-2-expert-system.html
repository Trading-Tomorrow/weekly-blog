    <p>During our second week, our project started to take a more defined shape. We held two highly productive meetings with domain experts, which provided us with valuable insights into the world of future trading. These discussions went beyond the basics, touching on complex factors such as the potential impact of global events — like pandemics — on the value of commodities. It was fascinating to see how external and often unpredictable circumstances can influence investment decisions in such a significant way.</p>

    <p>Building on the knowledge we gathered, we began outlining the key variables that will serve as the backbone of our expert system. This step was crucial in transforming theoretical understanding into practical components that the system can use to make informed decisions.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, we established a clear objective for our project: to design a system capable of advising whether or not to invest in a given commodity, based on the knowledge and expertise we provide. With this goal in mind, we are now ready to move forward, turning our initial ideas into a decision-making tool that reflects the complexity and dynamics of real-world trading.</p>
